The EGCFE has three main program elements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean fossil energy policy (with a focus on coal trade)<\/li>\n<li>Clean fossil energy technology<\/li>\n<li>Oil and gas<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The EGCFE promotes clean fossil energy options by facilitating, coordinating, and implementing a variety of activities, including projects, studies, workshops, and other meetings related to clean and efficient production and use of fossil fuels. EGCFE activities concurrently enhance economic development and mitigate the local, regional, and global environmental impacts (e.g., air emissions, water, and waste management) related to the entire fossil fuel production and use cycle throughout the region.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about how the EGCFE contributes to the EWG Strategic Plan and APEC leaders&#8217; goals, <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/apec\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/EGCFE-Contributions-to-the-EWG-Strategic-Plan-and-Leaders-Goals.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">read the report<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Beyond Clean Coal<\/h2>\n<p>Thirteen of APEC\u2019s twenty-one member economies are significant producers and\/or consumers of coal, and most of the EGCFE\u2019s activities are coal related. In fact, the EGCFE began as the Expert Group on Clean Coal Technologies (EGCCT) in the early 1990s. After the EGCFE expanded its work to include studies and workshops on unconventional gas, liquid natural gas, and elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, it was renamed in the late 1990s.
